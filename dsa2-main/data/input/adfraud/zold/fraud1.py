# # Introduction

# ### 1) Add interaction features
# Here you'll add interaction features for each pair of categorical features (ip, app, device, os, channel). The easiest way to iterate through the pairs of features is with `itertools.combinations`. For each new column, join the values as strings with an underscore, so 13 and 47 would become `"13_47"`. As you add the new columns to the dataset, be sure to label encode the values.


# ### Data leakage using clicks/entire dataset to LabelEncode ???

# # Generating numerical features 
# Adding interactions is a quick way to create more categorical features from the data. It's also effective to create new numerical features, you'll typically get a lot of improvement in the model. This takes a bit of brainstorming and experimentation to find features that work well.
# For these exercises I'm going to have you implement functions that operate on Pandas Series. It can take multiple minutes to run these functions on the entire data set so instead I'll provide feedback by running your function on a smaller dataset.


# ### 2) Number of events in the past six hours 
# The first feature you'll be creating is the number of events from the same IP in the last six hours. It's likely that someone who is visiting often will download the app.
# Implement a function `count_past_events` that takes a Series of click times (timestamps) and returns another Series with the number of events in the last six hours. **Tip:** The `rolling` method is useful for this.


def count_past_events(series):
    new_series = pd.Series(index=series, data=series.index, name="count_6_hours").sort_index()
    print(new_series.head())
    count_6_hours = new_series.rolling('6h').count() - 1
    return count_6_hours



# Because this can take a while to calculate on the full data, we'll load pre-calculated versions in the cell below to test model performance.
# Loading in from saved Parquet file
past_events = pd.read_parquet('../input/feature-engineering-data/past_6hr_events.pqt')

#train, valid, test = get_data_splits(clicks)
#_ = train_model(train, valid)
valid_name_model='V11 FIN ip_past_6hr_counts'
my_own_train_plot_model(clicks, valid_name_model, my_own_metrics)


# ### 3) Features from future information 
# In the last exercise you created a feature that looked at past events. You could also make features that use information from events in the future. Should you use future events or not? 


# ### 4) Time since last event
# Implement a function `time_diff` that calculates the time since the last event in seconds from a Series of timestamps. This will be ran like so:
# ```python
# timedeltas = clicks.groupby('ip')['click_time'].transform(time_diff)
# ```


def time_diff(series):
    """Returns a series with the time since the last timestamp in seconds."""
    time_since_last_event = series.diff().dt.total_seconds()
    return time_since_last_event


# We'll again load pre-computed versions of the data, which match what your function would return
# Loading in from saved Parquet file

clicks['past_events_6hr'] = past_events

#train, valid, test = get_data_splits(clicks.join(past_events))
#_ = train_model(train, valid)


valid_name_model='V12 FIN time_since_last_event'
my_own_train_plot_model(clicks, valid_name_model, my_own_metrics)




# ### 5) Number of previous app downloads
# It's likely that if a visitor downloaded an app previously, 
# it'll affect the likelihood they'll download one again. Implement a function `previous_attributions` that returns a Series with the number of times an app has been downloaded (`'is_attributed' == 1`) before the current event.
def previous_attributions(series):
    """Returns a series with the number of times an app has been downloaded."""
    print(series)
    print(series.expanding(min_periods=2).sum())
    sums = series.expanding(min_periods=2).sum() - series
    return sums


# Again loading pre-computed data.
# Loading in from saved Parquet file
past_events = pd.read_parquet('../input/feature-engineering-data/downloads.pqt')
#clicks['ip_past_6hr_counts'] = past_events ??? Typo to overwrite ???
clicks['prev_app_downloads'] = past_events 
       
#train, valid, test = get_data_splits(clicks)
#_ = train_model(train, valid)


valid_name_model = 'V13 FIN prev_app_downloads'
my_own_train_plot_model(clicks, valid_name_model, my_own_metrics)


# ### 6) Tree-based vs Neural Network Models
# So far we've been using LightGBM, a tree-based model. Would these features we've generated work well for neural networks as well as tree-based models?
# Now that you've generated a bunch of different features, you'll typically want to remove some of them to reduce the size of the model and potentially improve the performance. Next, I'll show you how to do feature selection using a few different methods such as L1 regression and Boruta.
# You know how to generate a lot of features. In practice, you'll frequently want to pare them down for modeling. Learn to do that in the **[Feature Selection lesson](https://www.kaggle.com/matleonard/feature-selection)**.
