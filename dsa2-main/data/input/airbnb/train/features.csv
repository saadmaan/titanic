I changed my conditions to a minimum stay of 2 months due to the new law in place since May 1st 2016. You will be handed over a proper rental agreement so you will be able to register yourself at the ""Bürgeramt"".

About the area: Countless pubs, restaurants, cafés, galleries and little shops create a day and nightlife atmosphere unrivalled in the rest of Berlin. Along with Schöneberg and Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg is a focal point of the Berlin art scene. Along with Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg it is also a popular neighbourhood with the student population. Prenzlauer Berg is one of the most popular central districts in Berlin and one of the prettiest neighbourhoods, still central, yet quieter than Berlin Mitte. Much of Prenzlauer Berg escaped damage in the second world war and post war redevelopment. Nowadays Prenzlauer Berg offers trendy shopping with many street style fashion designers selling their wares in trendy boutiques.","SINCE JAN 1st 2014 BERLIN HAS INTRODUCED A ""TOURIST TAX"" (5% of the Netto Price + VAT) THAT HAS TO BE PAID DIRECTLY TO THE APARTMENT OWNER.

Choosing this place I attached great importance on lots of light, very central and quiet location with balcony and lift. I equipped this place with all the amenities that I like to find when I am travelling myself. 

At the same time I am not overly pretentious, but I feel most comfortable whenever the place is clean and clear. 
I am also delighted about every little amenity which makes my stay comfortable and which gives me a quick orientation. 

For my guests I followed this idea: mineral water, coffee, tea to start with, cooling and cooking opportunities, ingredients such as salt, pepper, oil, vinegar … and a dish washer – all this you can take for granted. As well as convenient city maps, umbrella (just in case), recommendations for almost everything: cafés, bars, clubs, museums, all kind of transport facilities and handy hints – even off the beaten tourist track.    

My guests can expect: washing machine, flat iron, ironing board, and for activities inside the apartment after a long day trip or a hard working day a few delivery services for lovely meals and drinks. 

During busy times of course I am always accessible via mobile phone. I am open minded regarding special requests. Do not hesitate to ask.

The cozy studio apartment we are offering used to be our own vacation home while we were living in NYC.
In our free time we love to take advantage of Berlin's extensive offerings of cultural life - museums, theaters, concerts etc. We also love to ride our bikes to explore the city and its surrounding forests and many lakes.  If you like, we can give you a tour through the very dynamic city of Berlin - on foot, on bike or using its excellent public transportation system.
We would also be interested in exchanging/switching apartments with other airbnb hosts in our favorite travel spots NYC and Barcelona-Sitges or Gran Canaria.
Please, feel free to contact us if you would like to know more about us and the apartment.

I have a 3 rooms apartment in the center of Berlin(DE) and a Mountain Home in Granada(ES).

My apartment in the center of Berlin, close to Potsdamer Platz.
It is very close to almost all the sights, you can walk everywhere from here, also the metro is just a few steps from my door step. 
Its also very convenient to have a supermarket just downstairs on the building and a Shopping Mall (MALL OF BERLIN) just across the street.

The Mountain Home in Granada is 25 minutes to the center of Granada, up in the mountains in a Little and Brightful village called Güéjar Sierra, also only 20 Minutes to the top of Sierra Nevada. Laying at precise 1000meters (3000ft), Güéjar Sierra is quiet and picturesque and at the same time active and full with options for outdoors activities from simple walking to hardest climbing.
 
Both Places are my Home Sweet Home and I love going to both places despite of the difference of the 2 locations. I which you can enjoy mt set even when I'm not around.

In the east it is joined to a new long-drawn-out park that connects it with Kreuzberg, not far from the former Tempelhof airport, whose free runways are now used for many sports. To the west it borders the residential district of Wilmersdorf. At its heart is the large Schöneberger Rathaus where Kennedy gave his famous speech.","Airport:  From Airport Tegel it takes about 14 min.by taxi to get to the apartment and costs about € 26. By public transportation it takes about 25 minutes. Take the Bus ""X9"" to the train station ""Zoologischer Garten / Zoo"" and then the bus ""M46"" (direction ""Südkreuz"") until bus-station ""Motzstr."" From there it`s perhaps 200m.

You can also take the ""S-Bahn / railway"" until ""Innsbrucker-Platz"" and from there the ""U4"". But sometimes the S-Bahn is not driving. So I recommend to take the underground.

Or is it the U1 directly to Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain with their lively night life? For shopping enthusiasts, the KaDeWe and the Kurfürstendamm at Wittenberg Platz are also only 10 minutes far. Or you just take the Metrobus M46, which runs every 10 min. driving off from the side street (Martin-Luther-Str.) to the Zoologischer Garten (Zoo) and the Southern Cross (Südkreuz).

The kitchen is fully equipped, with tea making facilities, a microwave, a toaster, an electric cooker with ceramic hob, a refrigerator, a dishwasher, a coffee maker, cooking utensils, and much more. Feel free to use whatever you need. Basic condiments and spices for cooking are of course also available. Everything necessary for baking is also there since I like to bake. A washing machine is also available; please ask me for assistance if you wish to use it.

Otherwise, I am of course glad to provide tips on the best places in Berlin whenever wanted, depending on what the guest is interested in. Sometimes I can also offer a small city tour, but only when desired. It is important to me that the guest is left alone and only given information when it is wanted.","A house rules there though and this is hanging out by the landlord in the stairwell, but in all previous guests this really was not necessary.

I bought this property to have a base in Europe. I have chosen Berlin because it is vibrant, full of energy, very individual, still embrace a rather hedonistic approach to life considering it is one of the main capital cities of Europe. The sub-culture, the art-scene- poor but sexy, a village feel yet with all the fantastic facilities that a city can offer. Most of all, Berlin changes its face with every moving second, yet, Berlin remains Berlin deep at heart. Where better place than the heart of the former Eastern Part of Berlin, Prenslauerberg?

Since the year 2000 I live and work as a designer in Berlin, mostly in Kreuzberg and Neukölln. I do know a lot of interesting spots to recommend in Berlin, but even for me there is still so much to explore in this fabulous city.

If I´m not in Berlin I travel a lot. My favorite countries are Thailand, Indonesia, Marocco, Cuba, Italy and Spain. Most of my trips got me to Spain.

My favorite cities around the world are Bangkok, Istanbul, Madrid, Sevilla, Barcelona and Essouira.

Many years ago I began dedicating myself to issues surrounding poverty and the environment after an extended trip through Asia and Africa in 2000. I began to wonder – what if you could harness the power of the free market to solve the problems of poverty, hunger, inequality?
My personal journey has taken me to many places on this planet in many capacities. As a young student growing up in the United States during the height of the cold war, I could not phantom why people on the other side of the world would want to kill me. Conflict and conflict management in international affairs became an underlying theme in everything I did. I visited the Soviet Union to dispel the myth. Later I became a professor of transition theory at the University in Kiev, Ukraine, worked in the State Department of the United States, launched an internet company, established a foundation and consulted international organizations such as the OSCE and the Council of Europe. I discovered there are many ways to tackle conflict. But where could I have the most impact?
Now, I am focusing my efforts nearly 100% on Social Business as a Social Entrepreneur – a pioneering model for nothing less than a new, humane form of capitalism. I understood that conflict prevention starts with reducing poverty. I have always liked the motto “Doing well by doing good” and am motivated by triple bottom line metrics – people planet profit.
